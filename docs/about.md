# About the Author

Hi, Guillem here! 

I'm a developer working at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and
programming, with a focus on data science and computational problems. What
started as a practical tool to visualize satellite orientations and quaternion
mathematics quickly grew into something bigger... and then it just got out of
hand :shrug:


If you'd like to connect:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/GCBallesteros)
- [Maxwell Rules](https://maxwellrules.com) (my personal site)

If you find any of this useful or cool please consider starring the project on GitHub. No
tracking, no ads - just a tool that I hope others might find helpful
too.
