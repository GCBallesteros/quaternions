# What on Earth?

What on Earth is a versatile tool for exploring quaternions, geometry, and
satellite perspectives—all from the comfort of your browser. Deployed as a web
application, it allows you to perform complex geometric calculations, visualize
scenes from a satellite’s viewpoint, and optimize quaternions under various
constraints.

## Key Features

- **Geometric Calculations**: Compute angles, distances, and other geometrical
properties.
- **Satellite Perspectives**: Simulate and analyze views from a satellite’s
camera, complete with orientation and field of view adjustments.
- **Quaternion Optimization**: Determine the best quaternion given constraints
such as:
  - Specific camera orientations.
  - Alignment of secondary vectors or targets.
- **User-Driven Scripting**: Write and execute scripts directly in the app’s
built-in editor using a custom API or DSL, enabling:
  - Adding new points or objects to the scene.
  - Performing calculations on-the-fly.
  - Automating workflows for repeated tasks.
  - ... much more coming soon.
